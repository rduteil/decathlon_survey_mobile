# decathlon_survey_mobile
Decathlon Survey project's mobile application (react-native)

This project was realised during an internship at Solutec.

The main objective was to build a web & mobile platform used by Decathlon's employees to create surveys and gather results.

This repository contains the mobile application, built in react-native and communicating with the back-end through a GraphQL API.
